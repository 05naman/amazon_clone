# amazon_clone
 I'm excited to share my latest project: an Amazon Home-Page Clone created entirely with HTML and CSS! This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive deep into front-end design and showcase what can be achieved using just these two core web technologies. The result is a pixel-perfect replica of the Amazon home page, designed to reflect the real site's layout and styling. This clone demonstrates my skills in creating intricate web layouts and handling responsive design challenges without relying on JavaScript or external libraries.
